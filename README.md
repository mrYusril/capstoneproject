# Introduction

Hello there,

This is my first Readme file for my **Capstone Project Module 1** from Purwadhika which I'm very excited to share. This project present the fundamentals of CRUD application, my first application made with Visual Code using Python language to write it. The application is a menu-ordering app in a cafe which I named, Norways_Cafe().

In this project, I've implemented several features such as:
 - Create: Adding an item (drink/food) to the menu list
 - Read: Display the menu list (drink/food) from the database
 - Update: Updating values (stock, price) of items from the database
 - Delete: Remove an item (food/drink) from the database

If there is a suggestion or recommendation, I'm very open to have a discussion with you guys which will improve me as a better Data Scientist. Thankss!!

Also, I hope my project can give you something useful for your programming journey

# A Menu-Ordering App, Norways_Cafe()
This project is to help the developer(me) for understanding the fundamentals of Python Prgoramming especially in CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) concept by build an menu-ordering application. This application has several follwoing features:

## Description
**1. Product Catalog**
   - Displays Menu  : The application can displays the menu to the customer from dictionary-                        based database that consist primary key and values (name, stock, price, 
                      category) for each item whether drink or food menu
   - Filtered-result: The application can displays filtered-result menu to the customer based 
                      on his/her choice (by inputting) such as Coffee or Non-Coffee for the 
                      drinks menu and Main Course, Salty Snack, Sweet Snack for the foods menu.
     
**2. Order Management**
  - Add to Order List: The application add several customer's order using a list named,                                total_orders[]
  - Multiple Order: The application offers multiple order choice whether after customer     
                       ordered drink(s), he/she can keep ordering drink(s) or switch to     ordering food(s). When the cutomer ordered food(s), he/she can keep 
                       ordering food(s) or switch to ordering dring(s)

  **3. Billing System**
   - Calculate Bill: The application sum of all total orders quantity multiplied by its price The Billing system uses variable total_orders (to store all drinks_order and foods_order) and total_bills (sum of quantity multiplied with its price of all orders)
   - Printing the Bill: The application stores what customer order consist information such as name, Qty (quantity), price, and the total price. The application prints the Bill just like in a real-life scenario

  **4. Inventory Management**
  - Update value: The application can update values from menu list such as stock
